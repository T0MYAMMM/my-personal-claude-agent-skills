## Usage Tips

1. **Prioritize questions** based on implementation impact
2. **Ask 3-5 questions max** per refinement session
3. **Provide context** for why each question matters
4. **Offer options** when asking multiple-choice questions
5. **Follow up** on ambiguous answers
6. **Document answers** in task acceptance criteria
7. **Update technical approach** based on answers
