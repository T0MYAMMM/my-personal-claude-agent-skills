## Key Takeaways from Examples

### Common Patterns

1. **Initial plans are often too simple** - Missing edge cases, validation rules, and UX details
2. **Security and performance are often overlooked** - Rate limiting, authorization, caching
3. **User experience details matter** - Notifications, feedback, error handling
4. **Admin/management tools needed** - Moderation, audit logs, bulk actions

### Impact of Refinement

- **Prevents rework** - Catches requirements early
- **Improves quality** - Forces thinking about edge cases
- **Sets expectations** - User knows full scope upfront
- **Better estimates** - More accurate task breakdown

### Best Questions to Ask

1. **Edge cases** - What happens when X fails or is unusual?
2. **Permissions** - Who can do what?
3. **User experience** - How should this feel to use?
4. **Performance** - How fast must this be?
5. **Security** - What could go wrong?
6. **Scale** - How many records/users/requests?
