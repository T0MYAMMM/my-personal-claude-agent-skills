          Add your project rules and guidelines here.

          ## Overview

          Describe the purpose of these rules and when they apply.

          ## Guidelines

          - Add specific guidelines
          - Include best practices
          - Document conventions
          - Provide examples

          ## Common Patterns

          Show examples of correct patterns to follow.

          ## Anti-Patterns

          Show examples of what to avoid.

      def testing_template_content
        <<~CONTENT
          Guidelines for writing and maintaining tests in this project.

          ## Test Structure

          - One test file per source file
          - Use descriptive test names
          - Group related tests together
          - Keep tests focused and independent

          ## Best Practices

          - Write tests before or alongside code
          - Use appropriate test types (unit, integration, system)
          - Mock external dependencies
          - Keep tests fast and reliable

          ## Coverage Requirements

          - Aim for high test coverage
          - Focus on critical paths
          - Test edge cases and error conditions
        CONTENT

      def security_template_content
        <<~CONTENT
          Security guidelines and requirements for this project.

          ## Input Validation

          - Always validate and sanitize user input
          - Use strong parameters in controllers
          - Never trust external data

          ## Authentication & Authorization

          - Implement proper authentication
          - Enforce authorization for sensitive actions
          - Use secure session management

          ## Common Vulnerabilities

          Protect against:
          - SQL Injection
          - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
          - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
          - Mass Assignment
          - Insecure Direct Object References

          ## Dependencies

          - Keep dependencies up to date
          - Run security audits regularly
          - Review security advisories

      def performance_template_content
        <<~CONTENT
          Performance optimization guidelines for this project.

          ## Database Queries

          - Avoid N+1 queries (use eager loading)
          - Add appropriate indexes
          - Limit data returned from queries
          - Use database-specific optimizations

          ## Caching

          - Cache expensive operations
          - Use fragment caching for views
          - Implement HTTP caching headers
          - Consider background jobs for slow tasks

          ## Asset Optimization

          - Minimize and compress assets
          - Use CDN for static assets
          - Implement lazy loading where appropriate
          - Optimize images and media files

          ## Monitoring

          - Track performance metrics
          - Monitor query performance
          - Set up alerts for slowdowns
          - Profile code regularly
