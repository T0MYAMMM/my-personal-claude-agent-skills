```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill covers

tags:
  - relevant
  - tags
---

def install_fullstack_preset
  # ... existing skills ...
  install_skill("my-new-skill")  # Add here
end
```

### Adding a New Command

---

# My Rule

## Purpose
