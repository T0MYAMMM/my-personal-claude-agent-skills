2 endpoints across 2 groups. See references/api-spec.lap for full details.

### TrafficLoops.fmw
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /TrafficLoops.fmw | Provides all the traffic loops maintained by the City of Surrey in GeoJSON format. LANE_DIRECTION indicates the heading of the traffic (NB, SB, EB, WB). INTERSECTION_ID corresponds to the INTID field in the intersections dataset which can be found on the Surrey Open Data site. ROAD_FACILITYID indicates which road segment the loop is located on.  This corresponds to the FACILITYID in the Road Centrelines dataset on the City of Surrey Open Data site. |

### TrafficLoopCounts.fmw
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /TrafficLoopCounts.fmw | Provides traffic loop counts for the input time interval. The LOOP_ID and DATETIME combinations are unique in the output. The output timestamp will contain the time zone offset, either -08 (PST) or -07 (PDT) depending on whether daylight savings time was observed at the output datetime. In order to work with local time you may omit the time zone offset from the input and truncate it from the output. |
