### findings
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /findings/import | Imports security findings generated by a finding provider into Security Hub. This action is requested by the finding provider to import its findings into Security Hub.  BatchImportFindings must be called by one of the following:   The Amazon Web Services account that is associated with a finding if you are using the default product ARN or are a partner sending findings from within a customer's Amazon Web Services account. In these cases, the identifier of the account that you are calling BatchImportFindings from needs to be the same as the AwsAccountId attribute for the finding.   An Amazon Web Services account that Security Hub has allow-listed for an official partner integration. In this case, you can call BatchImportFindings from the allow-listed account and send findings from different customer accounts in the same batch.   The maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned for any finding larger than 240 Kb. After a finding is created, BatchImportFindings cannot be used to update the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub customers use to manage their investigation workflow.    Note     UserDefinedFields     VerificationState     Workflow    Finding providers also should not use BatchImportFindings to update the following attributes.    Confidence     Criticality     RelatedFindings     Severity     Types    Instead, finding providers use FindingProviderFields to provide values for these attributes. |
| PATCH | /findings/batchupdate | Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their investigation into a finding. Requested by administrator accounts or member accounts. Administrator accounts can update findings for their account and their member accounts. Member accounts can update findings for their account. Updates from BatchUpdateFindings do not affect the value of UpdatedAt for a finding. Administrator and member accounts can use BatchUpdateFindings to update the following finding fields and objects.    Confidence     Criticality     Note     RelatedFindings     Severity     Types     UserDefinedFields     VerificationState     Workflow    You can configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be able to suppress findings or change the finding severity. See Configuring access to BatchUpdateFindings in the Security Hub User Guide. |
| POST | /findings | Returns a list of findings that match the specified criteria. If finding aggregation is enabled, then when you call GetFindings from the aggregation Region, the results include all of the matching findings from both the aggregation Region and the linked Regions. |
| PATCH | /findings | UpdateFindings is a deprecated operation. Instead of UpdateFindings, use the BatchUpdateFindings operation. The UpdateFindings operation updates the Note and RecordState of the Security Hub aggregated findings that the filter attributes specify. Any member account that can view the finding can also see the update to the finding. Finding updates made with UpdateFindings aren't persisted if the same finding is later updated by the finding provider through the BatchImportFindings operation. In addition, Security Hub doesn't record updates made with UpdateFindings in the finding history. |

### actionTargets

### members
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /members | Creates a member association in Security Hub between the specified accounts and the account used to make the request, which is the administrator account. If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account.  CreateMembers is always used to add accounts that are not organization members. For accounts that are managed using Organizations, CreateMembers is only used in the following cases:   Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization accounts.   The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.   This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the EnableSecurityHub operation. For accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the InviteMembers operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.   If the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account.   For organization accounts that already have Security Hub enabled, Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not change their enabled standards or controls.   A permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account. To remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the DisassociateFromMasterAccount or DisassociateMembers operation. |
| POST | /members/delete | Deletes the specified member accounts from Security Hub. You can invoke this API only to delete accounts that became members through invitation. You can't invoke this API to delete accounts that belong to an Organizations organization. |
| POST | /members/disassociate | Disassociates the specified member accounts from the associated administrator account. Can be used to disassociate both accounts that are managed using Organizations and accounts that were invited manually. |
| POST | /members/get | Returns the details for the Security Hub member accounts for the specified account IDs. An administrator account can be either the delegated Security Hub administrator account for an organization or an administrator account that enabled Security Hub manually. The results include both member accounts that are managed using Organizations and accounts that were invited manually. |
| POST | /members/invite | Invites other Amazon Web Services accounts to become member accounts for the Security Hub administrator account that the invitation is sent from. This operation is only used to invite accounts that do not belong to an organization. Organization accounts do not receive invitations. Before you can use this action to invite a member, you must first use the CreateMembers action to create the member account in Security Hub. When the account owner enables Security Hub and accepts the invitation to become a member account, the administrator account can view the findings generated from the member account. |
| GET | /members | Lists details about all member accounts for the current Security Hub administrator account. The results include both member accounts that belong to an organization and member accounts that were invited manually. |

### invitations

| POST | /invitations/delete | Deletes invitations received by the Amazon Web Services account to become a member account. A Security Hub administrator account can use this operation to delete invitations sent to one or more member accounts. This operation is only used to delete invitations that are sent to member accounts that aren't part of an organization. Organization accounts don't receive invitations. |
| GET | /invitations/count | Returns the count of all Security Hub membership invitations that were sent to the current member account, not including the currently accepted invitation. |
| GET | /invitations | Lists all Security Hub membership invitations that were sent to the current Amazon Web Services account. This operation is only used by accounts that are managed by invitation. Accounts that are managed using the integration with Organizations do not receive invitations. |

|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /accounts | Returns details about the Hub resource in your account, including the HubArn and the time when you enabled Security Hub. |
| DELETE | /accounts | Disables Security Hub in your account only in the current Amazon Web Services Region. To disable Security Hub in all Regions, you must submit one request per Region where you have enabled Security Hub. You can't disable Security Hub in an account that is currently the Security Hub administrator. When you disable Security Hub, your existing findings and insights and any Security Hub configuration settings are deleted after 90 days and cannot be recovered. Any standards that were enabled are disabled, and your administrator and member account associations are removed. If you want to save your existing findings, you must export them before you disable Security Hub. |
| POST | /accounts | Enables Security Hub for your account in the current Region or the Region you specify in the request. When you enable Security Hub, you grant to Security Hub the permissions necessary to gather findings from other services that are integrated with Security Hub. When you use the EnableSecurityHub operation to enable Security Hub, you also automatically enable the following standards:   Center for Internet Security (CIS) Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.2.0   Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices   Other standards are not automatically enabled.  To opt out of automatically enabled standards, set EnableDefaultStandards to false. After you enable Security Hub, to enable a standard, use the BatchEnableStandards operation.
