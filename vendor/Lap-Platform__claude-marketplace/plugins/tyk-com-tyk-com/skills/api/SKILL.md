- "Delete a key?" -> DELETE /tyk/keys/{keyId}
- "List all apis?" -> GET /tyk/apis/
- "Create a apis?" -> POST /tyk/apis/
- "Get apis details?" -> GET /tyk/apis/{apiID}
- "Delete a apis?" -> DELETE /tyk/apis/{apiID}
- "Update a apis?" -> PUT /tyk/apis/{apiID}
- "List all health?" -> GET /tyk/health/
- "List all reload?" -> GET /tyk/reload/
- "List all group?" -> GET /tyk/reload/group
- "Create a create?" -> POST /tyk/oauth/clients/create
- "Delete a client?" -> DELETE /tyk/oauth/clients/{apiId}/{clientId}
- "Get client details?" -> GET /tyk/oauth/clients/{apiId}
- "Create a authorize-client?" -> POST /tyk/oauth/authorize-client/
- "Delete a refresh?" -> DELETE /tyk/oauth/refresh/{keyId}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
