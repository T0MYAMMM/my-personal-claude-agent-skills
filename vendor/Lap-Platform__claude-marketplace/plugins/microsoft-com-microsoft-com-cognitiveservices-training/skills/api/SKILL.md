# Custom Vision Training Client
API version: 3.2

## Auth
ApiKey Training-Key in header

## Base URL

## Setup
1. Set your API key in the appropriate header
2. GET /domains -- verify access
3. POST /projects -- create first projects

## Endpoints

48 endpoints across 2 groups. See references/api-spec.lap for full details.
