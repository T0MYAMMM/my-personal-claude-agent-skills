## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Delete a policyAssignment?" -> DELETE /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}
- "Update a policyAssignment?" -> PUT /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}
- "Get policyAssignment details?" -> GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/{policyAssignmentName}
- "List all policyAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments
- "List all policyAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{parentResourcePath}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments
- "List all policyAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
