- "List all leads?" -> GET /lead/leads
- "Create a lead?" -> POST /lead/leads
- "Get lead details?" -> GET /lead/leads/{id}
- "Partially update a lead?" -> PATCH /lead/leads/{id}
- "Delete a lead?" -> DELETE /lead/leads/{id}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object
