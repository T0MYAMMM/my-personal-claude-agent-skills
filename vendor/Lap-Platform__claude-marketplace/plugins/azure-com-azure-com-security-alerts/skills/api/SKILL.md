## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all alerts?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/alerts
- "List all alerts?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/alerts
- "List all alerts?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts
- "List all alerts?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts
- "Get alert details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts/{alertName}
- "Get alert details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts/{alertName}
- "Create a dismiss?" -> POST /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts/{alertName}/dismiss
- "Create a reactivate?" -> POST /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts/{alertName}/reactivate
- "Create a dismiss?" -> POST /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts/{alertName}/dismiss
- "Create a reactivate?" -> POST /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/alerts/{alertName}/reactivate
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
