## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all grants?" -> GET /grants
- "Create a grant?" -> POST /grants
- "Get grant details?" -> GET /grants/{id}
- "List all transactions?" -> GET /transactions
- "Get transaction details?" -> GET /transactions/{id}
- "Create a transfer?" -> POST /transfers
- "Create a approve?" -> POST /transfers/approve
- "Create a cancel?" -> POST /transfers/cancel
- "Create a return?" -> POST /transfers/{transferId}/returns
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details

- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object
