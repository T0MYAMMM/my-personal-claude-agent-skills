## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all Executions?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions
- "Create a Execution?" -> POST /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions
- "Get Execution details?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions/{Sid}
- "Delete a Execution?" -> DELETE /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions/{Sid}
- "List all Context?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions/{ExecutionSid}/Context
- "List all Steps?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions/{ExecutionSid}/Steps
- "Get Step details?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions/{ExecutionSid}/Steps/{Sid}
- "List all Context?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{FlowSid}/Executions/{ExecutionSid}/Steps/{StepSid}/Context
- "Create a Flow?" -> POST /v2/Flows
- "List all Flows?" -> GET /v2/Flows
- "Get Flow details?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{Sid}
- "Delete a Flow?" -> DELETE /v2/Flows/{Sid}
- "List all Revisions?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{Sid}/Revisions
- "Get Revision details?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{Sid}/Revisions/{Revision}
- "Create a Validate?" -> POST /v2/Flows/Validate
- "List all TestUsers?" -> GET /v2/Flows/{Sid}/TestUsers
- "Create a TestUser?" -> POST /v2/Flows/{Sid}/TestUsers
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object
