### api
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| DELETE | /api/v1/documents/{DocumentId}/versions/{VersionId} | Aborts the upload of the specified document version that was previously initiated by InitiateDocumentVersionUpload. The client should make this call only when it no longer intends to upload the document version, or fails to do so. |
| POST | /api/v1/users/{UserId}/activation | Activates the specified user. Only active users can access Amazon WorkDocs. |
| POST | /api/v1/resources/{ResourceId}/permissions | Creates a set of permissions for the specified folder or document. The resource permissions are overwritten if the principals already have different permissions. |

| DELETE | /api/v1/documents/{DocumentId}/versions/{VersionId}/comment/{CommentId} | Deletes the specified comment from the document version. |
| DELETE | /api/v1/resources/{ResourceId}/customMetadata | Deletes custom metadata from the specified resource. |

| DELETE | /api/v1/users/{UserId} | Deletes the specified user from a Simple AD or Microsoft AD directory.  Deleting a user immediately and permanently deletes all content in that user's folder structure. Site retention policies do NOT apply to this type of deletion. |

| GET | /api/v1/me/root | Describes the current user's special folders; the RootFolder and the RecycleBin. RootFolder is the root of user's files and folders and RecycleBin is the root of recycled items. This is not a valid action for SigV4 (administrative API) clients.

| GET | /api/v1/resources | Retrieves a collection of resources, including folders and documents. The only CollectionType supported is SHARED_WITH_ME. |
| POST | /api/v1/documents | Creates a new document object and version object. The client specifies the parent folder ID and name of the document to upload. The ID is optionally specified when creating a new version of an existing document. This is the first step to upload a document. Next, upload the document to the URL returned from the call, and then call UpdateDocumentVersion. To cancel the document upload, call AbortDocumentVersionUpload. |
