| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | / | Associates a FirewallRuleGroup with a VPC, to provide DNS filtering for the VPC. |
| POST | / | Adds IP addresses to an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint. If you want to add more than one IP address, submit one AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress request for each IP address. To remove an IP address from an endpoint, see DisassociateResolverEndpointIpAddress. |
| POST | / | Associates an Amazon VPC with a specified query logging configuration. Route 53 Resolver logs DNS queries that originate in all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with a specified query logging configuration. To associate more than one VPC with a configuration, submit one AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig request for each VPC.  The VPCs that you associate with a query logging configuration must be in the same Region as the configuration.  To remove a VPC from a query logging configuration, see DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig. |
| POST | / | Associates a Resolver rule with a VPC. When you associate a rule with a VPC, Resolver forwards all DNS queries for the domain name that is specified in the rule and that originate in the VPC. The queries are forwarded to the IP addresses for the DNS resolvers that are specified in the rule. For more information about rules, see CreateResolverRule. |
| POST | / | Creates an empty firewall domain list for use in DNS Firewall rules. You can populate the domains for the new list with a file, using ImportFirewallDomains, or with domain strings, using UpdateFirewallDomains. |
| POST | / | Creates a single DNS Firewall rule in the specified rule group, using the specified domain list. |
| POST | / | Creates an empty DNS Firewall rule group for filtering DNS network traffic in a VPC. You can add rules to the new rule group by calling CreateFirewallRule. |
| POST | / | Creates a Route 53 Resolver on an Outpost. |
| POST | / | Creates a Resolver endpoint. There are two types of Resolver endpoints, inbound and outbound:   An inbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries to the DNS service for a VPC from your network.   An outbound Resolver endpoint forwards DNS queries from the DNS service for a VPC to your network. |
| POST | / | Creates a Resolver query logging configuration, which defines where you want Resolver to save DNS query logs that originate in your VPCs. Resolver can log queries only for VPCs that are in the same Region as the query logging configuration. To specify which VPCs you want to log queries for, you use AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig. For more information, see AssociateResolverQueryLogConfig.  You can optionally use Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other Amazon Web Services accounts. The other accounts can then associate VPCs with the configuration. The query logs that Resolver creates for a configuration include all DNS queries that originate in all VPCs that are associated with the configuration. |
| POST | / | For DNS queries that originate in your VPCs, specifies which Resolver endpoint the queries pass through, one domain name that you want to forward to your network, and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers in your network. |
| POST | / | Deletes the specified domain list. |
| POST | / | Deletes the specified firewall rule. |
| POST | / | Deletes the specified firewall rule group. |
| POST | / | Deletes a Resolver on the Outpost. |
| POST | / | Deletes a Resolver endpoint. The effect of deleting a Resolver endpoint depends on whether it's an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint:    Inbound: DNS queries from your network are no longer routed to the DNS service for the specified VPC.    Outbound: DNS queries from a VPC are no longer routed to your network. |
| POST | / | Deletes a query logging configuration. When you delete a configuration, Resolver stops logging DNS queries for all of the Amazon VPCs that are associated with the configuration. This also applies if the query logging configuration is shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, and the other accounts have associated VPCs with the shared configuration. Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. See DisassociateResolverQueryLogConfig. If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, you must stop sharing the configuration before you can delete a configuration. The accounts that you shared the configuration with can first disassociate VPCs that they associated with the configuration, but that's not necessary. If you stop sharing the configuration, those VPCs are automatically disassociated from the configuration. |
| POST | / | Deletes a Resolver rule. Before you can delete a Resolver rule, you must disassociate it from all the VPCs that you associated the Resolver rule with. For more information, see DisassociateResolverRule. |
| POST | / | Disassociates a FirewallRuleGroup from a VPC, to remove DNS filtering from the VPC. |
| POST | / | Removes IP addresses from an inbound or an outbound Resolver endpoint. If you want to remove more than one IP address, submit one DisassociateResolverEndpointIpAddress request for each IP address. To add an IP address to an endpoint, see AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress. |
| POST | / | Disassociates a VPC from a query logging configuration.  Before you can delete a query logging configuration, you must first disassociate all VPCs from the configuration. If you used Resource Access Manager (RAM) to share a query logging configuration with other accounts, VPCs can be disassociated from the configuration in the following ways:   The accounts that you shared the configuration with can disassociate VPCs from the configuration.   You can stop sharing the configuration. |
| POST | / | Removes the association between a specified Resolver rule and a specified VPC.  If you disassociate a Resolver rule from a VPC, Resolver stops forwarding DNS queries for the domain name that you specified in the Resolver rule. |

| POST | / | Returns the Identity and Access Management (Amazon Web Services IAM) policy for sharing the specified rule group. You can use the policy to share the rule group using Resource Access Manager (RAM). |
| POST | / | Gets information about a specified Resolver on the Outpost, such as its instance count and type, name, and the current status of the Resolver. |

| POST | / | Imports domain names from a file into a domain list, for use in a DNS firewall rule group.  Each domain specification in your domain list must satisfy the following requirements:    It can optionally start with * (asterisk).   With the exception of the optional starting asterisk, it must only contain the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen).   It must be from 1-255 characters in length. |
