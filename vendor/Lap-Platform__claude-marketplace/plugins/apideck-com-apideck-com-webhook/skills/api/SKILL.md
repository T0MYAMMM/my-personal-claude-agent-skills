Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all webhooks?" -> GET /webhook/webhooks
- "Create a webhook?" -> POST /webhook/webhooks
- "Get webhook details?" -> GET /webhook/webhooks/{id}
- "Partially update a webhook?" -> PATCH /webhook/webhooks/{id}
- "Delete a webhook?" -> DELETE /webhook/webhooks/{id}
- "Get w details?" -> GET /webhook/w/{id}/{serviceId}
- "List all logs?" -> GET /webhook/logs
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
