### translate
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /translate/braille | Translate from English to Braille. This is what you use if you have a braille display. This API translates the English text into characters that a braille display understands and you can feed the translated text directly to the display. |
| GET | /translate/braille/dots | Use this to see which dots are enabled for each Braille letters. This is highly educational (to see which dots are enabled) and can potentially drive a non braille display which works on individual dots. |
| GET | /translate/braille/unicode | Translate from English to Braille Unicode characters. |
| GET | /translate/braille/image | Translate from English to Braille image characters. This is probably what you want to use if you are displaying braille in a browser. |
| GET | /translate/braille/html | Translate from English to Braille Image characters. This is probably what you want to use if you are displaying braille in a browser. |
