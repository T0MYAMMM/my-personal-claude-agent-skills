## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all posts?" -> GET /users/{user_id}/posts
- "Search search?" -> GET /users/{user_id}/posts/search
- "List all groups?" -> GET /groups
- "Get group details?" -> GET /groups/{group_id}
- "List all multiple?" -> GET /groups/multiple
- "List all posts?" -> GET /posts
- "Search search?" -> GET /posts/search
- "List all all?" -> GET /posts/all
- "List all changes?" -> GET /posts/all/changes
- "List all display?" -> GET /posts/{post_id}/display
- "Get post details?" -> GET /posts/{post_id}
- "List all multiple?" -> GET /posts/multiple
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
