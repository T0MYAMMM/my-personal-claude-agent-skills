- "Get codereview details?" -> GET /codereviews/{CodeReviewArn}
- "Get feedback details?" -> GET /feedback/{CodeReviewArn}
- "Get association details?" -> GET /associations/{AssociationArn}
- "Delete a association?" -> DELETE /associations/{AssociationArn}
- "List all codereviews?" -> GET /codereviews
- "List all RecommendationFeedback?" -> GET /feedback/{CodeReviewArn}/RecommendationFeedback
- "List all Recommendations?" -> GET /codereviews/{CodeReviewArn}/Recommendations
- "List all associations?" -> GET /associations
- "Get tag details?" -> GET /tags/{resourceArn}
- "Delete a tag?" -> DELETE /tags/{resourceArn}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
