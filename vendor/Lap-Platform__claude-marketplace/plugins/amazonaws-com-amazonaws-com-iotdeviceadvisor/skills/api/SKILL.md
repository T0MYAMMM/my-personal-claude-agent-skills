## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Create a suiteDefinition?" -> POST /suiteDefinitions
- "Delete a suiteDefinition?" -> DELETE /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}
- "List all endpoint?" -> GET /endpoint
- "Get suiteDefinition details?" -> GET /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}
- "Get suiteRun details?" -> GET /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}/suiteRuns/{suiteRunId}
- "List all report?" -> GET /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}/suiteRuns/{suiteRunId}/report
- "List all suiteDefinitions?" -> GET /suiteDefinitions
- "List all suiteRuns?" -> GET /suiteRuns
- "Get tag details?" -> GET /tags/{resourceArn}
- "Create a suiteRun?" -> POST /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}/suiteRuns
- "Create a stop?" -> POST /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}/suiteRuns/{suiteRunId}/stop
- "Delete a tag?" -> DELETE /tags/{resourceArn}
- "Partially update a suiteDefinition?" -> PATCH /suiteDefinitions/{suiteDefinitionId}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object
