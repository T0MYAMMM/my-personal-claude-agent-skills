| POST | /apps/{appId}/branches/{branchName}/deployments | Creates a deployment for a manually deployed Amplify app. Manually deployed apps are not connected to a repository.  The maximum duration between the CreateDeployment call and the StartDeployment call cannot exceed 8 hours. If the duration exceeds 8 hours, the StartDeployment call and the associated Job will fail. |
