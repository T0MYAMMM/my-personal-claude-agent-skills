## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Create a key?" -> POST /key
- "Get key details?" -> GET /key/{PK}
- "Update a key?" -> PUT /key/{PK}
- "Delete a key?" -> DELETE /key/{PK}
- "Create a login?" -> POST /login
- "Create a scope?" -> POST /scope
- "Update a scope?" -> PUT /scope/{job}
- "Get scope details?" -> GET /scope/{job}
- "Delete a scope?" -> DELETE /scope/{job}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
