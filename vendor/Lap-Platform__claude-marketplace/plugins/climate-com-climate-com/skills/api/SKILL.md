# Climate FieldView Platform APIs
API version: 4.0.11

## Auth
OAuth2 | ApiKey X-Api-Key in header

## Base URL
https://platform.climate.com/

## Setup
1. Set your API key in the appropriate header
2. GET /v4/fields -- verify access
3. POST /v4/boundaries/query -- create first query

## Endpoints

28 endpoints across 8 groups. See references/api-spec.lap for full details.

- "Get resourceOwner details?" -> GET /v4/resourceOwners/{resourceOwnerId}
- "Get boundary details?" -> GET /v4/boundaries/{boundaryId}
- "Create a query?" -> POST /v4/boundaries/query
- "Create a boundary?" -> POST /v4/boundaries
- "Create a upload?" -> POST /v4/uploads
- "Update a upload?" -> PUT /v4/uploads/{uploadId}
- "List all status?" -> GET /v4/uploads/{uploadId}/status
- "Create a query?" -> POST /v4/uploads/status/query
- "Create a export?" -> POST /v4/exports
- "List all status?" -> GET /v4/exports/{exportId}/status
- "List all contents?" -> GET /v4/exports/{exportId}/contents
- "List all scoutingObservations?" -> GET /v4/layers/scoutingObservations
- "Get scoutingObservation details?" -> GET /v4/layers/scoutingObservations/{scoutingObservationId}
- "List all attachments?" -> GET /v4/layers/scoutingObservations/{scoutingObservationId}/attachments
- "List all contents?" -> GET /v4/layers/scoutingObservations/{scoutingObservationId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/contents
- "List all asPlanted?" -> GET /v4/layers/asPlanted
- "List all contents?" -> GET /v4/layers/asPlanted/{activityId}/contents
- "Get asPlanted details?" -> GET /v4/layers/asPlanted/{activityId}
- "List all asApplied?" -> GET /v4/layers/asApplied
