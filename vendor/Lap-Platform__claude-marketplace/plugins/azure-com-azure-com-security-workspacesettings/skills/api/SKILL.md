## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all workspaceSettings?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/workspaceSettings
- "Get workspaceSetting details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/workspaceSettings/{workspaceSettingName}
- "Update a workspaceSetting?" -> PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/workspaceSettings/{workspaceSettingName}
- "Partially update a workspaceSetting?" -> PATCH /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/workspaceSettings/{workspaceSettingName}
- "Delete a workspaceSetting?" -> DELETE /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/workspaceSettings/{workspaceSettingName}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
