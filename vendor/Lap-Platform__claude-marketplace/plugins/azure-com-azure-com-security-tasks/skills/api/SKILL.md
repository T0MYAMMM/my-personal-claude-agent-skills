## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all tasks?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/tasks
- "List all tasks?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/tasks
- "Get task details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/tasks/{taskName}
- "List all tasks?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/tasks
- "Get task details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/locations/{ascLocation}/tasks/{taskName}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
