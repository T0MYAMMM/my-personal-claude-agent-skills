### root
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | / | Adds a member (user or group) to the resource's set of delegates. |
| POST | / | Adds a member (user or group) to the group's set. |
| POST | / | Assumes an impersonation role for the given WorkMail organization. This method returns an authentication token you can use to make impersonated calls. |
| POST | / | Cancels a mailbox export job.  If the mailbox export job is near completion, it might not be possible to cancel it. |
| POST | / | Adds an alias to the set of a given member (user or group) of WorkMail. |
| POST | / | Creates an AvailabilityConfiguration for the given WorkMail organization and domain. |
| POST | / | Creates a group that can be used in WorkMail by calling the RegisterToWorkMail operation. |
| POST | / | Creates an impersonation role for the given WorkMail organization.  Idempotency ensures that an API request completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request completes successfully, any subsequent retries also complete successfully without performing any further actions. |
| POST | / | Creates a new mobile device access rule for the specified WorkMail organization. |
| POST | / | Creates a new WorkMail organization. Optionally, you can choose to associate an existing AWS Directory Service directory with your organization. If an AWS Directory Service directory ID is specified, the organization alias must match the directory alias. If you choose not to associate an existing directory with your organization, then we create a new WorkMail directory for you. For more information, see Adding an organization in the WorkMail Administrator Guide. You can associate multiple email domains with an organization, then choose your default email domain from the WorkMail console. You can also associate a domain that is managed in an Amazon Route 53 public hosted zone. For more information, see Adding a domain and Choosing the default domain in the WorkMail Administrator Guide. Optionally, you can use a customer managed key from AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt email for your organization. If you don't associate an AWS KMS key, WorkMail creates a default, AWS managed key for you. |
| POST | / | Creates a new WorkMail resource. |
| POST | / | Creates a user who can be used in WorkMail by calling the RegisterToWorkMail operation. |
| POST | / | Deletes an access control rule for the specified WorkMail organization.  Deleting already deleted and non-existing rules does not produce an error. In those cases, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body. |
| POST | / | Remove one or more specified aliases from a set of aliases for a given user. |
| POST | / | Deletes the AvailabilityConfiguration for the given WorkMail organization and domain. |
| POST | / | Deletes the email monitoring configuration for a specified organization. |

| POST | / | Deletes an impersonation role for the given WorkMail organization. |
| POST | / | Deletes permissions granted to a member (user or group). |
| POST | / | Deletes the mobile device access override for the given WorkMail organization, user, and device.  Deleting already deleted and non-existing overrides does not produce an error. In those cases, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body. |
| POST | / | Deletes a mobile device access rule for the specified WorkMail organization.  Deleting already deleted and non-existing rules does not produce an error. In those cases, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response with an empty HTTP body. |
| POST | / | Deletes an WorkMail organization and all underlying AWS resources managed by WorkMail as part of the organization. You can choose whether to delete the associated directory. For more information, see Removing an organization in the WorkMail Administrator Guide. |
| POST | / | Deletes the specified resource. |
| POST | / | Deletes the specified retention policy from the specified organization. |
| POST | / | Deletes a user from WorkMail and all subsequent systems. Before you can delete a user, the user state must be DISABLED. Use the DescribeUser action to confirm the user state. Deleting a user is permanent and cannot be undone. WorkMail archives user mailboxes for 30 days before they are permanently removed. |
| POST | / | Mark a user, group, or resource as no longer used in WorkMail. This action disassociates the mailbox and schedules it for clean-up. WorkMail keeps mailboxes for 30 days before they are permanently removed. The functionality in the console is Disable. |
| POST | / | Removes a domain from WorkMail, stops email routing to WorkMail, and removes the authorization allowing WorkMail use. SES keeps the domain because other applications may use it. You must first remove any email address used by WorkMail entities before you remove the domain. |
| POST | / | Describes the current email monitoring configuration for a specified organization. |
| POST | / | Returns basic details about an entity in WorkMail. |
| POST | / | Returns the data available for the group. |

| POST | / | Registers an existing and disabled user, group, or resource for WorkMail use by associating a mailbox and calendaring capabilities. It performs no change if the user, group, or resource is enabled and fails if the user, group, or resource is deleted. This operation results in the accumulation of costs. For more information, see Pricing. The equivalent console functionality for this operation is Enable. Users can either be created by calling the CreateUser API operation or they can be synchronized from your directory. For more information, see DeregisterFromWorkMail. |
| POST | / | Allows the administrator to reset the password for a user. |

| POST | / | Performs a test on an availability provider to ensure that access is allowed. For EWS, it verifies the provided credentials can be used to successfully log in. For Lambda, it verifies that the Lambda function can be invoked and that the resource access policy was configured to deny anonymous access. An anonymous invocation is one done without providing either a SourceArn or SourceAccount header.  The request must contain either one provider definition (EwsProvider or LambdaProvider) or the DomainName parameter. If the DomainName parameter is provided, the configuration stored under the DomainName will be tested. |
| POST | / | Untags the specified tags from the specified WorkMail organization resource. |
