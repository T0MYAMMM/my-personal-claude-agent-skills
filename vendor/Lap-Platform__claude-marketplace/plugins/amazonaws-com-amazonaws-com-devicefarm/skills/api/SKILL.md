| POST | / | Deletes the specified tags from a resource. |
| POST | / | Updates information about a private device instance. |
| POST | / | Modifies the name, description, and rules in a device pool given the attributes and the pool ARN. Rule updates are all-or-nothing, meaning they can only be updated as a whole (or not at all). |

## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object

## References
