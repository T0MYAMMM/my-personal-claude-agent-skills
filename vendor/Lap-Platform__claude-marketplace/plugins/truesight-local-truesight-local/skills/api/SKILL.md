## Base URL
/tsws/10.0/api/

## Setup
1. Set your API key in the appropriate header
2. GET /hardware/applications -- verify access
3. POST /hardware/actions/{deviceId}/collect-now -- create first collect-now

## Endpoints

23 endpoints across 1 groups. See references/api-spec.lap for full details.
