### find_eligible_items
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /find_eligible_items | This method evaluates a seller's current listings and returns the set of IDs that are eligible for a seller-initiated discount offer to a buyer.  <br><br>A listing ID is returned only when one or more buyers have shown an "interest" in the listing.  <br><br>If any buyers have shown interest in a listing, the seller can initiate a "negotiation" with them by calling <a href="/api-docs/sell/negotiation/resources/offer/methods/sendOfferToInterestedBuyers">sendOfferToInterestedBuyers</a>, which sends all interested buyers a message that offers the listing at a discount.  <br><br>For details about how to create seller offers to buyers, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/offers-to-buyers.html" title="Selling Integration Guide">Sending offers to buyers</a>. |

### send_offer_to_interested_buyers
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /send_offer_to_interested_buyers | This method sends eligible buyers offers to purchase items in a listing at a discount.  <br><br>When a buyer has shown <i>interest</i> in a listing, they become "eligible" to receive a seller-initiated offer to purchase the item(s).  <br><br>Sellers use <a href="/api-docs/sell/negotiation/resources/offer/methods/findEligibleItems">findEligibleItems</a> to get the set of listings that have interested buyers. If a listing has interested buyers, sellers can use this method (<b>sendOfferToInterestedBuyers</b>) to send an offer to the buyers who are interested in the listing. The offer gives buyers the ability to purchase the associated listings at a discounted price.  <br><br>For details about how to create seller offers to buyers, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/offers-to-buyers.html" title="Selling Integration Guide">Sending offers to buyers</a>. |
