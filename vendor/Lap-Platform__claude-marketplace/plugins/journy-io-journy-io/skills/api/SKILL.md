- "Create a upsert?" -> POST /users/upsert
- "Create a upsert?" -> POST /accounts/upsert
- "Create a add?" -> POST /accounts/users/add
- "Create a remove?" -> POST /accounts/users/remove
- "List all users?" -> GET /properties/users
- "List all accounts?" -> GET /properties/accounts
- "List all validate?" -> GET /validate
- "List all snippet?" -> GET /tracking/snippet
- "Create a track?" -> POST /track
- "List all users?" -> GET /segments/users
- "List all accounts?" -> GET /segments/accounts
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
