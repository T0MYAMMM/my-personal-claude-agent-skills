- "Create a harvest_job?" -> POST /harvest_jobs
- "Create a origin_endpoint?" -> POST /origin_endpoints
- "Delete a channel?" -> DELETE /channels/{id}
- "Delete a origin_endpoint?" -> DELETE /origin_endpoints/{id}
- "Get channel details?" -> GET /channels/{id}
- "Get harvest_job details?" -> GET /harvest_jobs/{id}
- "Get origin_endpoint details?" -> GET /origin_endpoints/{id}
- "List all channels?" -> GET /channels
- "List all harvest_jobs?" -> GET /harvest_jobs
- "List all origin_endpoints?" -> GET /origin_endpoints
- "Get tag details?" -> GET /tags/{resource-arn}
- "Delete a tag?" -> DELETE /tags/{resource-arn}
- "Update a channel?" -> PUT /channels/{id}
- "Update a origin_endpoint?" -> PUT /origin_endpoints/{id}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
