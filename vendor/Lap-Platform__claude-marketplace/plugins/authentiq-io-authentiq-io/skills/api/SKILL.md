Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all authorize?" -> GET /authorize
- "Create a token?" -> POST /token
- "List all userinfo?" -> GET /userinfo
- "List all client?" -> GET /client
- "Create a client?" -> POST /client
- "Get client details?" -> GET /client/{client_id}
- "Update a client?" -> PUT /client/{client_id}
- "Delete a client?" -> DELETE /client/{client_id}
- "List all iframe?" -> GET /{client_id}/iframe
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
