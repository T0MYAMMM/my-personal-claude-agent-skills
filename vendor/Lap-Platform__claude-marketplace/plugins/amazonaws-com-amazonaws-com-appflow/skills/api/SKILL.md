### cancel-flow-executions
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /cancel-flow-executions | Cancels active runs for a flow. You can cancel all of the active runs for a flow, or you can cancel specific runs by providing their IDs. You can cancel a flow run only when the run is in progress. You can't cancel a run that has already completed or failed. You also can't cancel a run that's scheduled to occur but hasn't started yet. To prevent a scheduled run, you can deactivate the flow with the StopFlow action. You cannot resume a run after you cancel it. When you send your request, the status for each run becomes CancelStarted. When the cancellation completes, the status becomes Canceled.  When you cancel a run, you still incur charges for any data that the run already processed before the cancellation. If the run had already written some data to the flow destination, then that data remains in the destination. If you configured the flow to use a batch API (such as the Salesforce Bulk API 2.0), then the run will finish reading or writing its entire batch of data after the cancellation. For these operations, the data processing charges for Amazon AppFlow apply. For the pricing information, see Amazon AppFlow pricing. |

### create-connector-profile
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /create-connector-profile | Creates a new connector profile associated with your Amazon Web Services account. There is a soft quota of 100 connector profiles per Amazon Web Services account. If you need more connector profiles than this quota allows, you can submit a request to the Amazon AppFlow team through the Amazon AppFlow support channel. In each connector profile that you create, you can provide the credentials and properties for only one connector. |

### create-flow
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /create-flow | Enables your application to create a new flow using Amazon AppFlow. You must create a connector profile before calling this API. Please note that the Request Syntax below shows syntax for multiple destinations, however, you can only transfer data to one item in this list at a time. Amazon AppFlow does not currently support flows to multiple destinations at once. |

### delete-connector-profile
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /delete-connector-profile | Enables you to delete an existing connector profile. |

### delete-flow
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

### describe-connector
| Method | Path | Description |

### describe-connector-profiles
| Method | Path | Description |

Both input lists are optional, and you can use them to filter the result.  If no names or connector-types are provided, returns all connector profiles in a paginated form. If there is no match, this operation returns an empty list. |

### describe-connectors
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /describe-connectors | Describes the connectors vended by Amazon AppFlow for specified connector types. If you don't specify a connector type, this operation describes all connectors vended by Amazon AppFlow. If there are more connectors than can be returned in one page, the response contains a nextToken object, which can be be passed in to the next call to the DescribeConnectors API operation to retrieve the next page. |
