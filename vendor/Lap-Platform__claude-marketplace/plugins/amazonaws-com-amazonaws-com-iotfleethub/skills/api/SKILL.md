- "Get application details?" -> GET /applications/{applicationId}
- "List all applications?" -> GET /applications
- "Get tag details?" -> GET /tags/{resourceArn}
- "Delete a tag?" -> DELETE /tags/{resourceArn}
- "Partially update a application?" -> PATCH /applications/{applicationId}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
