- "Get pipeline details?" -> GET /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}
- "Update a pipeline?" -> PUT /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}
- "Delete a pipeline?" -> DELETE /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}
- "Partially update a pipeline?" -> PATCH /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}
- "List all audit?" -> GET /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/audit
- "List all stages?" -> GET /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages
- "Create a stage?" -> POST /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages
- "Get stage details?" -> GET /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages/{stageId}
- "Update a stage?" -> PUT /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages/{stageId}
- "Delete a stage?" -> DELETE /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages/{stageId}
- "Partially update a stage?" -> PATCH /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages/{stageId}
- "List all audit?" -> GET /crm/v3/pipelines/{objectType}/{pipelineId}/stages/{stageId}/audit
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
