| GET | /attachments | Returns a list of core network attachments. |
| POST | /attachments/{attachmentId}/reject | Rejects a core network attachment request. |

### global-networks
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /global-networks/{globalNetworkId}/connect-peer-associations | Associates a core network Connect peer with a device and optionally, with a link.  If you specify a link, it must be associated with the specified device. You can only associate core network Connect peers that have been created on a core network Connect attachment on a core network. |
| POST | /global-networks/{globalNetworkId}/customer-gateway-associations | Associates a customer gateway with a device and optionally, with a link. If you specify a link, it must be associated with the specified device.  You can only associate customer gateways that are connected to a VPN attachment on a transit gateway or core network registered in your global network. When you register a transit gateway or core network, customer gateways that are connected to the transit gateway are automatically included in the global network. To list customer gateways that are connected to a transit gateway, use the DescribeVpnConnections EC2 API and filter by transit-gateway-id. You cannot associate a customer gateway with more than one device and link. |
| POST | /global-networks/{globalNetworkId}/link-associations | Associates a link to a device. A device can be associated to multiple links and a link can be associated to multiple devices. The device and link must be in the same global network and the same site. |
| POST | /global-networks/{globalNetworkId}/transit-gateway-connect-peer-associations | Associates a transit gateway Connect peer with a device, and optionally, with a link. If you specify a link, it must be associated with the specified device.  You can only associate transit gateway Connect peers that have been created on a transit gateway that's registered in your global network. You cannot associate a transit gateway Connect peer with more than one device and link. |
