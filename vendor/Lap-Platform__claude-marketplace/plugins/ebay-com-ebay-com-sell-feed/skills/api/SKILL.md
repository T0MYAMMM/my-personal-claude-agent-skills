### order_task
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /order_task | This method returns the details and status for an array of order tasks based on a specified <strong>feed_type</strong> or <strong>schedule_id</strong>. Specifying both <strong>feed_type</strong> and <strong>schedule_id</strong> results in an error. Since schedules are based on feed types, you can specify a schedule (<strong>schedule_id</strong>) that returns the needed <strong>feed_type</strong>.<br /><br />If specifying the <strong>feed_type</strong>, limit which order tasks are returned by specifying filters such as the creation date range or period of time using <strong>look_back_days</strong>. <br /><br />If specifying a <strong>schedule_id</strong>, the schedule template (that the <strong>schedule_id</strong> is based on) determines which order tasks are returned (see <strong>schedule_id</strong> for additional information). Each <strong>schedule_id</strong> applies to one <strong>feed_type</strong>. |
| POST | /order_task | This method creates an order download task with filter criteria for the order report. When using this method, specify the <b> feedType</b>, <b> schemaVersion</b>, and <b> filterCriteria</b> for the report. The method returns the <b> location</b> response header containing the getOrderTask call URI to retrieve the order task you just created. The URL includes the eBay-assigned task ID, which you can use to reference the order task. <br /><br />To retrieve the status of the task, use the <b>getOrderTask</b> method to retrieve a single task ID or the <b>getOrderTasks</b> method to retrieve multiple order task IDs.<p> <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> The scope depends on the feed type. An error message results when an unsupported scope or feed type is specified.</span></p><p>The following list contains this method's authorization scope and its corresponding feed type:<ul><li>https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.fulfillment: LMS_ORDER_REPORT</li></ul> </p><p>For details about how this method is used, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/feed/general-feed-tasks.html" target="_blank">General feed types</a> in the Selling Integration Guide. <p> <span class="tablenote"><strong>Note:</strong> At this time, the <strong>createOrderTask</strong> method only supports order creation date filters and not modified order date filters.
