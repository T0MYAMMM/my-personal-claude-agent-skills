- "Update a blueprint?" -> PUT /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}
- "Get blueprint details?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}
- "Delete a blueprint?" -> DELETE /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}
- "List all blueprints?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints
- "Update a artifact?" -> PUT /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/artifacts/{artifactName}
- "Get artifact details?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/artifacts/{artifactName}
- "Delete a artifact?" -> DELETE /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/artifacts/{artifactName}
- "List all artifacts?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/artifacts
- "Update a version?" -> PUT /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/versions/{versionId}
- "Get version details?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/versions/{versionId}
- "Delete a version?" -> DELETE /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/versions/{versionId}
- "List all versions?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/versions
- "Get artifact details?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/versions/{versionId}/artifacts/{artifactName}
- "List all artifacts?" -> GET /{resourceScope}/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/{blueprintName}/versions/{versionId}/artifacts
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
