- "Get connector details?" -> GET /connector/connectors/{id}
- "Get doc details?" -> GET /connector/connectors/{id}/docs/{doc_id}
- "Get resource details?" -> GET /connector/connectors/{id}/resources/{resource_id}
- "List all schema?" -> GET /connector/connectors/{id}/resources/{resource_id}/unified_api/{api_id}/schema
- "List all example?" -> GET /connector/connectors/{id}/resources/{resource_id}/unified_api/{api_id}/example
- "List all apis?" -> GET /connector/apis
- "Get apis details?" -> GET /connector/apis/{id}
- "Get resource details?" -> GET /connector/apis/{id}/resources/{resource_id}
- "List all coverage?" -> GET /connector/apis/{id}/resources/{resource_id}/coverage
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
