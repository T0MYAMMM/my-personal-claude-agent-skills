| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/policy/attach | Attaches a policy object to a regular object. An object can have a limited number of attached policies. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/index/attach | Attaches the specified object to the specified index. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/typedlink/attach | Attaches a typed link to a specified source and target object. For more information, see Typed Links. |
| POST | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/batchread | Performs all the read operations in a batch. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/batchwrite | Performs all the write operations in a batch. Either all the operations succeed or none. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/directory/create | Creates a Directory by copying the published schema into the directory. A directory cannot be created without a schema. You can also quickly create a directory using a managed schema, called the QuickStartSchema. For more information, see Managed Schema in the Amazon Cloud Directory Developer Guide. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/facet/create | Creates a new Facet in a schema. Facet creation is allowed only in development or applied schemas. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/index | Creates an index object. See Indexing and search for more information. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/object | Creates an object in a Directory. Additionally attaches the object to a parent, if a parent reference and LinkName is specified. An object is simply a collection of Facet attributes. You can also use this API call to create a policy object, if the facet from which you create the object is a policy facet. |
| PUT | /amazonclouddirectory/2017-01-11/schema/create | Creates a new schema in a development state. A schema can exist in three phases:    Development: This is a mutable phase of the schema. All new schemas are in the development phase. Once the schema is finalized, it can be published.    Published: Published schemas are immutable and have a version associated with them.    Applied: Applied schemas are mutable in a way that allows you to add new schema facets. You can also add new, nonrequired attributes to existing schema facets. You can apply only published schemas to directories. |
