- "List all messages?" -> GET /sms/messages
- "Create a message?" -> POST /sms/messages
- "Get message details?" -> GET /sms/messages/{id}
- "Partially update a message?" -> PATCH /sms/messages/{id}
- "Delete a message?" -> DELETE /sms/messages/{id}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
