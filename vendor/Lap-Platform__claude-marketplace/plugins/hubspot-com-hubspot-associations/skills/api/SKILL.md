## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Create a archive?" -> POST /crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/archive
- "Create a default?" -> POST /crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/associate/default
- "Create a create?" -> POST /crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/create
- "Create a archive?" -> POST /crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/labels/archive
- "Create a read?" -> POST /crm/v4/associations/{fromObjectType}/{toObjectType}/batch/read
- "Update a default?" -> PUT /crm/v4/objects/{fromObjectType}/{fromObjectId}/associations/default/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}
- "Get association details?" -> GET /crm/v4/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}
- "Update a association?" -> PUT /crm/v4/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}
- "Delete a association?" -> DELETE /crm/v4/objects/{objectType}/{objectId}/associations/{toObjectType}/{toObjectId}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
