### 2020-08-01
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/eula-acceptances | Accept EULAs. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/launch-profiles | Create a launch profile. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/streaming-images | Creates a streaming image resource in a studio. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/streaming-sessions | Creates a streaming session in a studio. After invoking this operation, you must poll GetStreamingSession until the streaming session is in the READY state. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/streaming-sessions/{sessionId}/streams | Creates a streaming session stream for a streaming session. After invoking this API, invoke GetStreamingSessionStream with the returned streamId to poll the resource until it is in the READY state. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios | Create a new studio. When creating a studio, two IAM roles must be provided: the admin role and the user role. These roles are assumed by your users when they log in to the Nimble Studio portal. The user role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioUser managed policy attached for the portal to function properly. The admin role must have the AmazonNimbleStudio-StudioAdmin managed policy attached for the portal to function properly. You may optionally specify a KMS key in the StudioEncryptionConfiguration. In Nimble Studio, resource names, descriptions, initialization scripts, and other data you provide are always encrypted at rest using an KMS key. By default, this key is owned by Amazon Web Services and managed on your behalf. You may provide your own KMS key when calling CreateStudio to encrypt this data using a key you own and manage. When providing an KMS key during studio creation, Nimble Studio creates KMS grants in your account to provide your studio user and admin roles access to these KMS keys. If you delete this grant, the studio will no longer be accessible to your portal users. If you delete the studio KMS key, your studio will no longer be accessible. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/studio-components | Creates a studio component resource. |
| DELETE | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/launch-profiles/{launchProfileId} | Permanently delete a launch profile. |

| DELETE | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/streaming-sessions/{sessionId} | Deletes streaming session resource. After invoking this operation, use GetStreamingSession to poll the resource until it transitions to a DELETED state. A streaming session will count against your streaming session quota until it is marked DELETED. |

| GET | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/streaming-sessions/{sessionId}/streams/{streamId} | Gets a StreamingSessionStream for a streaming session. Invoke this operation to poll the resource after invoking CreateStreamingSessionStream. After the StreamingSessionStream changes to the READY state, the url property will contain a stream to be used with the DCV streaming client. |

If the studio does not have a valid IAM Identity Center configuration currently associated with it, then a new IAM Identity Center application is created for the studio and the studio is changed to the READY state. After the IAM Identity Center application is repaired, you must use the Amazon Nimble Studio console to add administrators and users to your studio. |
| POST | /2020-08-01/studios/{studioId}/streaming-sessions/{sessionId}/stop | Transitions sessions from the READY state into the STOPPED state. The STOP_IN_PROGRESS state is the intermediate state between the READY and STOPPED states. |
