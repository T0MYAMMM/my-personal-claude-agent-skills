### email
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /v2/email/metrics/batch | Retrieves batches of metric data collected based on your sending activity. You can execute this operation no more than 16 times per second, and with at most 160 queries from the batches per second (cumulative). |
| PUT | /v2/email/export-jobs/{JobId}/cancel | Cancels an export job. |
| POST | /v2/email/configuration-sets | Create a configuration set. Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails that you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by specifying the name of the configuration set when you call the Amazon SES API v2. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. |
| POST | /v2/email/configuration-sets/{ConfigurationSetName}/event-destinations | Create an event destination. Events include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon EventBridge and associate a rule to send the event to the specified target. A single configuration set can include more than one event destination. |
| POST | /v2/email/contact-lists/{ContactListName}/contacts | Creates a contact, which is an end-user who is receiving the email, and adds them to a contact list. |
| POST | /v2/email/contact-lists | Creates a contact list. |
| POST | /v2/email/custom-verification-email-templates | Creates a new custom verification email template. For more information about custom verification email templates, see Using custom verification email templates in the Amazon SES Developer Guide. You can execute this operation no more than once per second. |
| POST | /v2/email/dedicated-ip-pools | Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You can associate a pool with a configuration set. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, the message is sent from one of the addresses in the associated pool. |
| POST | /v2/email/deliverability-dashboard/test | Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon SES then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test. |
| POST | /v2/email/identities | Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An identity is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity. When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.  When you verify a domain without specifying the DkimSigningAttributes object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as Easy DKIM. Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the CreateEmailIdentity operation has to include the DkimSigningAttributes object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key. When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to complete the domain verification process. Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the email identity that you're verifying. |
| POST | /v2/email/identities/{EmailIdentity}/policies/{PolicyName} | Creates the specified sending authorization policy for the given identity (an email address or a domain).  This API is for the identity owner only. If you have not verified the identity, this API will return an error.  Sending authorization is a feature that enables an identity owner to authorize other senders to use its identities. For information about using sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. You can execute this operation no more than once per second. |
| POST | /v2/email/templates | Creates an email template. Email templates enable you to send personalized email to one or more destinations in a single API operation. For more information, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide. You can execute this operation no more than once per second. |
| POST | /v2/email/export-jobs | Creates an export job for a data source and destination. You can execute this operation no more than once per second. |
| POST | /v2/email/import-jobs | Creates an import job for a data destination. |
| DELETE | /v2/email/configuration-sets/{ConfigurationSetName} | Delete an existing configuration set.  Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. |
| DELETE | /v2/email/configuration-sets/{ConfigurationSetName}/event-destinations/{EventDestinationName} | Delete an event destination.
