- "Delete a service?" -> DELETE /services/{id}
- "Create a upload?" -> POST /artifact/upload
- "List all count?" -> GET /jobs/count
- "List all secrets?" -> GET /secrets
- "Create a secret?" -> POST /secrets
- "Get secret details?" -> GET /secrets/{id}
- "Update a secret?" -> PUT /secrets/{id}
- "Delete a secret?" -> DELETE /secrets/{id}
- "List all count?" -> GET /secrets/count
- "Get service details?" -> GET /tests/service/{serviceId}
- "List all count?" -> GET /tests/service/{serviceId}/count
- "Get test details?" -> GET /tests/{id}
- "Get message details?" -> GET /tests/{id}/messages/{testCaseId}
- "Create a testCaseResult?" -> POST /tests/{id}/testCaseResult
