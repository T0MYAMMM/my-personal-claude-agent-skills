### findsimilars
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /findsimilars | Given query face's faceId, to search the similar-looking faces from a faceId array, a face list or a large face list. faceId array contains the faces created by [Face - Detect With Url](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithurl) or [Face - Detect With Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/detectwithstream), which will expire at the time specified by faceIdTimeToLive after creation. A "faceListId" is created by [FaceList - Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/facelist/create) containing persistedFaceIds that will not expire. And a "largeFaceListId" is created by [LargeFaceList - Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/largefacelist/create) containing persistedFaceIds that will also not expire. Depending on the input the returned similar faces list contains faceIds or persistedFaceIds ranked by similarity. |
