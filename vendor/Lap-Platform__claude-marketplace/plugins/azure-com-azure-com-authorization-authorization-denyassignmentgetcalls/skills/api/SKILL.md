- "List all denyAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/denyAssignments
- "List all denyAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/denyAssignments
- "Get denyAssignment details?" -> GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/denyAssignments/{denyAssignmentId}
- "List all denyAssignments?" -> GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/denyAssignments
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
