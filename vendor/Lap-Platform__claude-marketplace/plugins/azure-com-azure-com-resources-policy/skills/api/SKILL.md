## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Delete a policyassignment?" -> DELETE /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments/{policyAssignmentName}
- "Update a policyassignment?" -> PUT /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments/{policyAssignmentName}
- "Get policyassignment details?" -> GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments/{policyAssignmentName}
- "List all policyAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments
- "List all policyassignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{resourceProviderNamespace}/{parentResourcePath}/{resourceType}/{resourceName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments
- "List all policyassignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments
- "Update a policydefinition?" -> PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policydefinitions/{policyDefinitionName}
- "Delete a policydefinition?" -> DELETE /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policydefinitions/{policyDefinitionName}
- "Get policydefinition details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policydefinitions/{policyDefinitionName}
- "List all policydefinitions?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policydefinitions
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
