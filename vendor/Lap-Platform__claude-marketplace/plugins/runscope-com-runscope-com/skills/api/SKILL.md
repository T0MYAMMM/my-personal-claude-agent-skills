- "Create a bucket?" -> POST /buckets
- "Get bucket details?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}
- "Delete a bucket?" -> DELETE /buckets/{bucketKey}
- "List all messages?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/messages
- "Create a message?" -> POST /buckets/{bucketKey}/messages
- "List all errors?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/errors
- "Get message details?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/messages/{messageId}
- "List all tests?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests
- "Create a test?" -> POST /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests
- "Get test details?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}
- "Update a test?" -> PUT /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}
- "Delete a test?" -> DELETE /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}
- "List all steps?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/steps
- "Create a step?" -> POST /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/steps
- "Update a step?" -> PUT /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/steps/{stepId}
- "Delete a step?" -> DELETE /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/steps/{stepId}
- "List all environments?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/environments
- "Create a environment?" -> POST /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/environments
- "Update a environment?" -> PUT /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/environments/{environmentId}
- "List all metrics?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/tests/{testId}/metrics
- "List all environments?" -> GET /buckets/{bucketKey}/environments
