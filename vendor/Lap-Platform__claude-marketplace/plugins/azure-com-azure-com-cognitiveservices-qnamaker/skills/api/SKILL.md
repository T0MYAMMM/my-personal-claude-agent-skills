## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all endpointSettings?" -> GET /endpointSettings
- "List all endpointkeys?" -> GET /endpointkeys
- "Partially update a endpointkey?" -> PATCH /endpointkeys/{keyType}
- "List all alterations?" -> GET /alterations
- "List all knowledgebases?" -> GET /knowledgebases
- "Get operation details?" -> GET /operations/{operationId}
- "Get knowledgebase details?" -> GET /knowledgebases/{kbId}
- "Delete a knowledgebase?" -> DELETE /knowledgebases/{kbId}
- "Update a knowledgebase?" -> PUT /knowledgebases/{kbId}
- "Partially update a knowledgebase?" -> PATCH /knowledgebases/{kbId}
- "Create a create?" -> POST /knowledgebases/create
- "List all qna?" -> GET /knowledgebases/{kbId}/{environment}/qna
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
