- "List all devices?" -> GET /user/devices
- "Create a device?" -> POST /user/devices
- "Get device details?" -> GET /user/devices/{serial}
- "Delete a device?" -> DELETE /user/devices/{serial}
- "Create a remoteConnect?" -> POST /user/devices/{serial}/remoteConnect
- "List all accessTokens?" -> GET /user/accessTokens
- "List all devices?" -> GET /devices
- "Get device details?" -> GET /devices/{serial}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
