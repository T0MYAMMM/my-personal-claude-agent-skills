## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Get serviceLimit details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/resourceProviders/{providerId}/locations/{location}/serviceLimits/{resourceName}
- "Update a serviceLimit?" -> PUT /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/resourceProviders/{providerId}/locations/{location}/serviceLimits/{resourceName}
- "Partially update a serviceLimit?" -> PATCH /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/resourceProviders/{providerId}/locations/{location}/serviceLimits/{resourceName}
- "List all serviceLimits?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/resourceProviders/{providerId}/locations/{location}/serviceLimits
- "Get serviceLimitsRequest details?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/resourceProviders/{providerId}/locations/{location}/serviceLimitsRequests/{id}
- "List all serviceLimitsRequests?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/resourceProviders/{providerId}/locations/{location}/serviceLimitsRequests
- "List all autoQuotaIncrease?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Capacity/autoQuotaIncrease
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
