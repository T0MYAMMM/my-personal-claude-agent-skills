### AddLFTagsToResource
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /AddLFTagsToResource | Attaches one or more LF-tags to an existing resource. |

### AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML | Allows a caller to assume an IAM role decorated as the SAML user specified in the SAML assertion included in the request. This decoration allows Lake Formation to enforce access policies against the SAML users and groups. This API operation requires SAML federation setup in the caller’s account as it can only be called with valid SAML assertions. Lake Formation does not scope down the permission of the assumed role. All permissions attached to the role via the SAML federation setup will be included in the role session.   This decorated role is expected to access data in Amazon S3 by getting temporary access from Lake Formation which is authorized via the virtual API GetDataAccess. Therefore, all SAML roles that can be assumed via AssumeDecoratedRoleWithSAML must at a minimum include lakeformation:GetDataAccess in their role policies. A typical IAM policy attached to such a role would look as follows: |

### BatchGrantPermissions
| Method | Path | Description |

| POST | /BatchGrantPermissions | Batch operation to grant permissions to the principal. |

### BatchRevokePermissions
| Method | Path | Description |

### CommitTransaction
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /CommitTransaction | Attempts to commit the specified transaction. Returns an exception if the transaction was previously aborted. This API action is idempotent if called multiple times for the same transaction. |

### CreateDataCellsFilter

### DeleteObjectsOnCancel
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /DeleteObjectsOnCancel | For a specific governed table, provides a list of Amazon S3 objects that will be written during the current transaction and that can be automatically deleted if the transaction is canceled. Without this call, no Amazon S3 objects are automatically deleted when a transaction cancels.   The Glue ETL library function write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog() includes an option to automatically call DeleteObjectsOnCancel before writes. For more information, see Rolling Back Amazon S3 Writes. |

### DeregisterResource
| Method | Path | Description |

### GetTemporaryGluePartitionCredentials
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /GetTemporaryGluePartitionCredentials | This API is identical to GetTemporaryTableCredentials except that this is used when the target Data Catalog resource is of type Partition. Lake Formation restricts the permission of the vended credentials with the same scope down policy which restricts access to a single Amazon S3 prefix. |

### GetTemporaryGlueTableCredentials
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /GetTemporaryGlueTableCredentials | Allows a caller in a secure environment to assume a role with permission to access Amazon S3. In order to vend such credentials, Lake Formation assumes the role associated with a registered location, for example an Amazon S3 bucket, with a scope down policy which restricts the access to a single prefix. |

### PutDataLakeSettings
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /PutDataLakeSettings | Sets the list of data lake administrators who have admin privileges on all resources managed by Lake Formation. For more information on admin privileges, see Granting Lake Formation Permissions. This API replaces the current list of data lake admins with the new list being passed. To add an admin, fetch the current list and add the new admin to that list and pass that list in this API. |

### RegisterResource
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /RegisterResource | Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog. To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role. When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy. The following request registers a new location and gives Lake Formation permission to use the service-linked role to access that location.  ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket UseServiceLinkedRole = true  If UseServiceLinkedRole is not set to true, you must provide or set the RoleArn:  arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role |
