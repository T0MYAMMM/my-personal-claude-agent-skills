# BC Route Planner REST API
API version: 2.0.0

## Auth
ApiKey apikey in header

## Base URL
https://router.api.gov.bc.ca/

## Setup
1. Set your API key in the appropriate header
2. GET /distance.{outputFormat} -- verify access
3. POST /distance.{outputFormat} -- create first distance.{outputFormat}

## Endpoints

22 endpoints across 7 groups. See references/api-spec.lap for full details.

## Common Questions

Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "Get distance.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /distance.{outputFormat}
- "Get betweenPairs.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /distance/betweenPairs.{outputFormat}
- "Get route.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /route.{outputFormat}
- "Get directions.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /directions.{outputFormat}
- "Get optimalRoute.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /optimalRoute.{outputFormat}
- "Get optimalDirections.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /optimalDirections.{outputFormat}
- "Get distance.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /truck/distance.{outputFormat}
- "Get route.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /truck/route.{outputFormat}
- "Get directions.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /truck/directions.{outputFormat}
- "Get optimalRoute.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /truck/optimalRoute.{outputFormat}
- "Get optimalDirections.{outputFormat} details?" -> GET /truck/optimalDirections.{outputFormat}
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object
