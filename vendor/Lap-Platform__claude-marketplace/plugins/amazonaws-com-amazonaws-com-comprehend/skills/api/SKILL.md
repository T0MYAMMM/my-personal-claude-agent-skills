| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | / | Determines the dominant language of the input text for a batch of documents. For a list of languages that Amazon Comprehend can detect, see Amazon Comprehend Supported Languages. |
| POST | / | Inspects the text of a batch of documents for named entities and returns information about them. For more information about named entities, see Entities in the Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Detects the key noun phrases found in a batch of documents. |
| POST | / | Inspects a batch of documents and returns an inference of the prevailing sentiment, POSITIVE, NEUTRAL, MIXED, or NEGATIVE, in each one. |
| POST | / | Inspects the text of a batch of documents for the syntax and part of speech of the words in the document and returns information about them. For more information, see Syntax in the Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Inspects a batch of documents and returns a sentiment analysis for each entity identified in the documents. For more information about targeted sentiment, see Targeted sentiment in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Creates a classification request to analyze a single document in real-time. ClassifyDocument supports the following model types:   Custom classifier - a custom model that you have created and trained. For input, you can provide plain text, a single-page document (PDF, Word, or image), or Amazon Textract API output. For more information, see Custom classification in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide.   Prompt safety classifier - Amazon Comprehend provides a pre-trained model for classifying input prompts for generative AI applications. For input, you provide English plain text input. For prompt safety classification, the response includes only the Classes field. For more information about prompt safety classifiers, see Prompt safety classification in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide.   If the system detects errors while processing a page in the input document, the API response includes an Errors field that describes the errors. If the system detects a document-level error in your input document, the API returns an InvalidRequestException error response. For details about this exception, see  Errors in semi-structured documents in the Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Analyzes input text for the presence of personally identifiable information (PII) and returns the labels of identified PII entity types such as name, address, bank account number, or phone number. |
| POST | / | Creates a dataset to upload training or test data for a model associated with a flywheel. For more information about datasets, see  Flywheel overview in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Creates a new document classifier that you can use to categorize documents. To create a classifier, you provide a set of training documents that are labeled with the categories that you want to use. For more information, see Training classifier models in the Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Creates a model-specific endpoint for synchronous inference for a previously trained custom model For information about endpoints, see Managing endpoints. |
| POST | / | Creates an entity recognizer using submitted files. After your CreateEntityRecognizer request is submitted, you can check job status using the DescribeEntityRecognizer API. |
| POST | / | A flywheel is an Amazon Web Services resource that orchestrates the ongoing training of a model for custom classification or custom entity recognition. You can create a flywheel to start with an existing trained model, or Comprehend can create and train a new model. When you create the flywheel, Comprehend creates a data lake in your account. The data lake holds the training data and test data for all versions of the model. To use a flywheel with an existing trained model, you specify the active model version. Comprehend copies the model's training data and test data into the flywheel's data lake. To use the flywheel with a new model, you need to provide a dataset for training data (and optional test data) when you create the flywheel. For more information about flywheels, see  Flywheel overview in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Deletes a previously created document classifier Only those classifiers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model, a ResourceInUseException will be returned. This is an asynchronous action that puts the classifier into a DELETING state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the classifier disappears from your account and is no longer available for use. |
| POST | / | Deletes a model-specific endpoint for a previously-trained custom model. All endpoints must be deleted in order for the model to be deleted. For information about endpoints, see Managing endpoints. |
| POST | / | Deletes an entity recognizer. Only those recognizers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted. If an active inference job is using the model, a ResourceInUseException will be returned. This is an asynchronous action that puts the recognizer into a DELETING state, and it is then removed by a background job. Once removed, the recognizer disappears from your account and is no longer available for use. |
| POST | / | Deletes a flywheel. When you delete the flywheel, Amazon Comprehend does not delete the data lake or the model associated with the flywheel. For more information about flywheels, see  Flywheel overview in the Amazon Comprehend Developer Guide. |
| POST | / | Deletes a resource-based policy that is attached to a custom model. |

| POST | / | Detects named entities in input text when you use the pre-trained model. Detects custom entities if you have a custom entity recognition model.   When detecting named entities using the pre-trained model, use plain text as the input. For more information about named entities, see Entities in the Comprehend Developer Guide. When you use a custom entity recognition model, you can input plain text or you can upload a single-page input document (text, PDF, Word, or image).  If the system detects errors while processing a page in the input document, the API response includes an entry in Errors for each error.  If the system detects a document-level error in your input document, the API returns an InvalidRequestException error response.
