| POST | / | Associates the specified app block builder with the specified app block. |
| POST | / | Associates the specified application with the specified fleet. This is only supported for Elastic fleets. |
| POST | / | Associates an application to entitle. |
| POST | / | Associates the specified fleet with the specified stack. |
| POST | / | Associates the specified users with the specified stacks. Users in a user pool cannot be assigned to stacks with fleets that are joined to an Active Directory domain. |
| POST | / | Disassociates the specified users from the specified stacks. |
| POST | / | Copies the image within the same region or to a new region within the same AWS account. Note that any tags you added to the image will not be copied. |
| POST | / | Creates an app block. App blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the details about the virtual hard disk in an S3 bucket. It also stores the setup script with details about how to mount the virtual hard disk. The virtual hard disk includes the application binaries and other files necessary to launch your applications. Multiple applications can be assigned to a single app block. This is only supported for Elastic fleets. |
| POST | / | Creates an app block builder. |
| POST | / | Creates a URL to start a create app block builder streaming session. |
| POST | / | Creates an application. Applications are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the details about how to launch applications on Elastic fleet streaming instances. An application consists of the launch details, icon, and display name. Applications are associated with an app block that contains the application binaries and other files. The applications assigned to an Elastic fleet are the applications users can launch.  This is only supported for Elastic fleets. |
| POST | / | Creates a Directory Config object in AppStream 2.0. This object includes the configuration information required to join fleets and image builders to Microsoft Active Directory domains. |
| POST | / | Creates a new entitlement. Entitlements control access to specific applications within a stack, based on user attributes. Entitlements apply to SAML 2.0 federated user identities. Amazon AppStream 2.0 user pool and streaming URL users are entitled to all applications in a stack. Entitlements don't apply to the desktop stream view application, or to applications managed by a dynamic app provider using the Dynamic Application Framework. |
| POST | / | Creates a fleet. A fleet consists of streaming instances that your users access for their applications and desktops. |
| POST | / | Creates an image builder. An image builder is a virtual machine that is used to create an image. The initial state of the builder is PENDING. When it is ready, the state is RUNNING. |
| POST | / | Creates a URL to start an image builder streaming session. |
| POST | / | Creates a stack to start streaming applications to users. A stack consists of an associated fleet, user access policies, and storage configurations. |
| POST | / | Creates a temporary URL to start an AppStream 2.0 streaming session for the specified user. A streaming URL enables application streaming to be tested without user setup. |
| POST | / | Creates custom branding that customizes the appearance of the streaming application catalog page. |
| POST | / | Creates a new image with the latest Windows operating system updates, driver updates, and AppStream 2.0 agent software. For more information, see the "Update an Image by Using Managed AppStream 2.0 Image Updates" section in Administer Your AppStream 2.0 Images, in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide. |
