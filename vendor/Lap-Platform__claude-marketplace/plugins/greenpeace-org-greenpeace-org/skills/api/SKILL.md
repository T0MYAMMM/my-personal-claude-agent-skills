Match user requests to endpoints in references/api-spec.lap. Key patterns:
- "List all volunteers?" -> GET /volunteers
- "Get volunteer details?" -> GET /volunteers/{UUID}
- "List all groups?" -> GET /groups
- "Get group details?" -> GET /groups/{UUID}
- "List all events?" -> GET /events
- "Get event details?" -> GET /events/{UUID}

## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
