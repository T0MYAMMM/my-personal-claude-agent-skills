### email
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /v1/email/configuration-sets | Create a configuration set. Configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. |
| POST | /v1/email/configuration-sets/{ConfigurationSetName}/event-destinations | Create an event destination. In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. A single configuration set can include more than one event destination. |
| POST | /v1/email/dedicated-ip-pools | Create a new pool of dedicated IP addresses. A pool can include one or more dedicated IP addresses that are associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account. You can associate a pool with a configuration set. When you send an email that uses that configuration set, Amazon Pinpoint sends it using only the IP addresses in the associated pool. |
| POST | /v1/email/deliverability-dashboard/test | Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the GetDeliverabilityTestReport operation to view the results of the test. |
| POST | /v1/email/identities | Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint. In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email with Amazon Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By verifying an address, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint permission to send email from the address. When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.  When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process. |
| DELETE | /v1/email/configuration-sets/{ConfigurationSetName} | Delete an existing configuration set. In Amazon Pinpoint, configuration sets are groups of rules that you can apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email. |
| DELETE | /v1/email/configuration-sets/{ConfigurationSetName}/event-destinations/{EventDestinationName} | Delete an event destination. In Amazon Pinpoint, events include message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints. Event destinations are places that you can send information about these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to receive notifications when you receive bounces or complaints, or you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. |
| DELETE | /v1/email/dedicated-ip-pools/{PoolName} | Delete a dedicated IP pool. |
