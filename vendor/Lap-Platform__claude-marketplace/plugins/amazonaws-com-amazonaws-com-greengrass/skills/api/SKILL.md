### greengrass
| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| PUT | /greengrass/groups/{GroupId}/role | Associates a role with a group. Your Greengrass core will use the role to access AWS cloud services. The role's permissions should allow Greengrass core Lambda functions to perform actions against the cloud. |
| PUT | /greengrass/servicerole | Associates a role with your account. AWS IoT Greengrass will use the role to access your Lambda functions and AWS IoT resources. This is necessary for deployments to succeed. The role must have at least minimum permissions in the policy ''AWSGreengrassResourceAccessRolePolicy''. |
| POST | /greengrass/definition/connectors | Creates a connector definition. You may provide the initial version of the connector definition now or use ''CreateConnectorDefinitionVersion'' at a later time. |
| POST | /greengrass/definition/connectors/{ConnectorDefinitionId}/versions | Creates a version of a connector definition which has already been defined. |
| POST | /greengrass/definition/cores | Creates a core definition. You may provide the initial version of the core definition now or use ''CreateCoreDefinitionVersion'' at a later time. Greengrass groups must each contain exactly one Greengrass core. |
| POST | /greengrass/definition/cores/{CoreDefinitionId}/versions | Creates a version of a core definition that has already been defined. Greengrass groups must each contain exactly one Greengrass core. |

| POST | /greengrass/definition/functions | Creates a Lambda function definition which contains a list of Lambda functions and their configurations to be used in a group. You can create an initial version of the definition by providing a list of Lambda functions and their configurations now, or use ''CreateFunctionDefinitionVersion'' later. |
| POST | /greengrass/definition/functions/{FunctionDefinitionId}/versions | Creates a version of a Lambda function definition that has already been defined. |
| POST | /greengrass/groups | Creates a group. You may provide the initial version of the group or use ''CreateGroupVersion'' at a later time.
