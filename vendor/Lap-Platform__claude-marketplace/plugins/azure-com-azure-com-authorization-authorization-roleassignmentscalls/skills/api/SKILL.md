- "List all roleAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments
- "Delete a roleAssignment?" -> DELETE /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentName}
- "Update a roleAssignment?" -> PUT /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentName}
- "Get roleAssignment details?" -> GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/{roleAssignmentName}
- "List all roleAssignments?" -> GET /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments
- "List all roleAssignments?" -> GET /{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments
- "How to authenticate?" -> See Auth section
